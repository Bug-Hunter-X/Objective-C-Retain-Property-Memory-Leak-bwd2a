In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with properties declared using `retain` or `copy`.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

If `myString` is assigned a value multiple times without releasing the previous value, this results in a retain count leak.  Each assignment increases the retain count, but only the `dealloc` method attempts to decrease it.  If the object holding the instance of `MyClass` is released before `MyClass` is properly deallocated, `myString` can end up with an incorrect retain count causing memory leaks, especially problematic in applications with long lifecycles.
